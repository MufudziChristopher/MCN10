Designed to deliver outstanding part success and excellent surface finish, the system allows users to achieve first-time part success across a wide range of geometries. This is made possible by a fully re-engineered material platform, updated interface technology and new print profiles.",

With materials that meet or exceed MPIF standards and the use of high metal volume fraction media, high-pressure extrusion and vacuum sintering at temperatures of up to 1400°C, the system produces parts with densities of up to 98 percent - similar to cast parts.",
      "description6": "The Studio System 2 allows you to tailor parts to your exact needs. Print parts with walls up to 4mm thick or fully-dense parts (with no infill) up to 5.25mm thick. Adjust shell thickness to create stronger parts or enable faster processing. Optimize prints for build speed using the standard (400µm) print head, or print fine features with the high resolution (250µm) print head.",

The only requirements are an internet connection, ventilation and power, making it easy to quickly start printing metal parts.²",
      "description8": "The Studio System 2 helps you regain control of your prototyping pipeline by allowing design and engineering teams to focus on making the best possible products. The simplified, easy-to-manage process allows users to quickly iterate on designs, print parts and monitor build progress from their desk, and significantly reduces operator burden - parts go directly from the printer into the furnace, where a large retort with stackable shelving (10x the capacity of a similarly-sized tube furnace) allows for batch sintering.",

      "description1": "The Form 3L is an affordable large format 3D printer trusted by professionals for fast turnaround of industrial-quality parts.",
      "description2": "Print Large Parts, Fast\r\n​\r\n​Form 3L offers five times the build volume and two times the laser power of the Form 3.",
      "description3": "Perfectionism\r\nThat Scales\r\nWith advanced Low Force Stereolithography (LFS)™ technology, Formlabs has completely re-engineered resin-based 3D printing to drastically reduce the forces of the print process.",
      "description4": "Low Force Stereolithography (LFS)™ uses a flexible tank and linear illumination to deliver groundbreaking print quality and printer reliability.",
      "description5": "Twice the\r\nLaser Power\r\n​\r\nTwo staggered Light Processing Units (LPUs) inside the printer use a compact system of lenses and mirrors to deliver accurate, repeatable prints.\r\n25μm\r\nXY Resolution\r\n250mW\r\nLaser Power\r\nFaster printing:\r\nThe two LPUs work simultaneously along an optimized print path to efficiently blaze through parts of all sizes.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nCrisp, clean features:\r\nEach high-density laser passes through a spatial filter to guarantee a clean laser spot.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nConsistent precision:\r\nA parabolic mirror ensures that the laser prints perpendicular to the build plane, ensuring uniform print quality across the entire build platform.",
      "description6": "Nonstop\r\nPrinting\r\n​\r\nIntegrated sensors help maintain ideal print conditions and send you alerts about the state of your machine. \r\nHigh material capacity:\r\nThe Form 3L can hold two easy-to-switch resin cartridges, preventing interruptions during large print jobs.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nClosed-loop calibration:\r\nOptical sensors continuously correct for scale and power, and can even detect dust.\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\nUser-replaceable components:\r\nThe Light Processing Units, resin tank, rollers, and optics window can be replaced in-house, reducing the need for replacement printer shipments.",

      "description1": "With easy-to-use hardware, the Studio System 2 allows you to spend less time managing equipment and more time designing and fabricating parts. Change printheads with the press of a button, and change materials quickly with a refillable cartridge system that allows users to easily load material during print jobs and store excess material safely. A fully-accessible printer and sintering volume and a configurable furnace retort allow for maximum flexibility.",

A fully-accessible printer and sintering volume and a configurable furnace retort allow for maximum flexibility.",
      "description3": "Easily produce difficult-to-machine parts featuring complex geometry like undercuts and internal channels. Fabricate, the software at the heart of the Studio System, automates complicated metallurgical processes to produce high-quality parts with densities and feature accuracy similar to casting.",
      "description4": "The Studio System 2 leverages data and feedback from thousands of prints and hundreds of customers. Designed to deliver outstanding part success and excellent surface finish, the system allows users to achieve first-time part success across a wide range of geometries. This is made possible by a fully re-engineered material platform, updated interface technology and new print profiles.",
      "description5": "A heated build chamber and Desktop Metal-engineered print profiles produce excellent surface finish right out of the furnace, while a high strength gyroid infill now lightweights parts. With materials that meet or exceed MPIF standards and the use of high metal volume fraction media, high-pressure extrusion and vacuum sintering at temperatures of up to 1400°C, the system produces parts with densities of up to 98 percent - similar to cast parts.",
      "description6": "The Studio System 2 allows you to tailor parts to your exact needs. Print parts with walls up to 4mm thick or fully-dense parts (with no infill) up to 5.25mm thick. Adjust shell thickness to create stronger parts or enable faster processing. Optimize prints for build speed using the standard (400µm) print head, or print fine features with the high resolution (250µm) print head.",
      "description7": "The Studio System 2 features a two-step process that eliminates the need for solvents and uses materials that can be easily stored and handled, making it ideal for use in an office environment - no special facilities and no respiratory PPE needed. The only requirements are an internet connection, ventilation and power, making it easy to quickly start printing metal parts.²",
      "description8": "The Studio System 2 helps you regain control of your prototyping pipeline by allowing design and engineering teams to focus on making the best possible products. The simplified, easy-to-manage process allows users to quickly iterate on designs, print parts and monitor build progress from their desk, and significantly reduces operator burden - parts go directly from the printer into the furnace, where a large retort with stackable shelving (10x the capacity of a similarly-sized tube furnace) allows for batch sintering.",
